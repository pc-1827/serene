# üå∏ Serene - AI Mental Health Support Platform

## üìù Problem Statement

Postpartum depression (PPD) affects approximately 1 in 7 mothers, making it one of the most common complications of childbirth. Despite its prevalence, PPD remains severely underdiagnosed and undertreated, with only about 15% of affected women receiving appropriate care. The condition can have devastating consequences, including impaired mother-infant bonding, developmental delays in children, and in severe cases, thoughts of self-harm or harm to the baby. Traditional barriers to treatment include stigma, lack of screening, limited access to mental health professionals, and the logistical challenges of attending in-person therapy with a newborn. The critical postpartum period requires accessible, immediate, and personalized mental health support that can adapt to the unique needs of new mothers.

## üí° Solution
